# Welcome!

This organization contains open interactive textbooks created by employees from Delft University of Technology that are being hosted on GitHub and GitHub Pages. Book websites are shown on: https://oit.tudelft.nl/.

if you'd like to have your book here, request member access to the organisation at one of the owners:
- [Dennis van den Ouden-van der Horst](mailto:d.denouden-vanderhorst@tudelft.nl)
- [Tom van Woudenberg](mailto:t.r.vanwoudenberg@tudelft.nl) 

The owners have a shared responsibility of adding people to the organisation and can be approached for technical questions. This list of owners will grow soon! If you'd like to be an owner, reach out to one of the existing owners!

You can get started on your own account with the Teachbooks Template (https://github.com/TeachBooks/template) and transfer your repository to this organisation as soon as you're a member. After transferring, your book is online at https://oit.tudelft.nl/<book_repository>! As soon as you're a member, you can add new books yourself.
